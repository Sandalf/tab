#### Thanks to you, our community [raised thousands of dollars](https://tab.gladly.io/covid-19/) for the World Health Organization over the last few days.
#### In addition to health systems, COVID-19 has strained the ability of food banks to take care of people in need. The next phase of our support will help the [Food Bank for New York City](https://www.foodbanknyc.org/covid-19/) keep families fed during this crisis.
#### Right now, tabs you open are providing meals for our fellow humans in NYC. Together, we can feed thousands of people in needâ€”so please open a few tabs and encourage your friends to do the same!
