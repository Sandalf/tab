#### The spread of COVID-19 has been swift and destructive. We need a global response to support the health systems working to keep us all safe. As a free, simple, and at-home way to raise money for important causes, we will be running a special campaign for the foreseeable future to raise funds for the response efforts.
#### Donate your hearts to the COVID-19 solidarity fund and support the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) and their partners in a massive effort to help countries prevent, detect, and manage the novel coronavirusâ€”particularly where the needs are the greatest.
#### Please join us in supporting the [COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate).
